Live Reactive Composition with Max MSP

Open the Max patch "Env_Osc.maxpat" with your Max application to get started! Make sure you have a mic connected to Max so you can input signal. As for the audio files, they are meant to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the Max patch so that they can be used. Rest of instructions are in patch.
